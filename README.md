# Chess Cooperation (aka Real Time Chess)

Real time chess was my first MVC .NET app. It's quite old and dates back to 2014.

It was a project on which I was learning a new technology (a technology that is quite ancient by now), so the code is not that great by today’s standards – but still it holds a sentimental value.

In short: it’s an online chess game when both opponents can see each other’s moves not only after they are made but also when pieces are dragged over the board (as just have probably guessed - it uses web sockets quite heavily).
